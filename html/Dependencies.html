	<h1>Dependencies for this Package.</h1>

	Both the class itself and the class test program have dependencies on external software libraries.

	<h2>The class.</h2>

	The class depends only on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	In particular, it makes use of the following mathematical Factorial function which is provided by the GSL;

	<br>
	<br>

	<div class="command">
	double gsl_sf_fact(usigned int n)
	</div>

	<br>

	where it is used in the calculation for each of the values of the components for Euler's formula.

	<h2>The class test program.</h2>
	
	The class test program depends only on the Boost library.

	<br>
	<br>

	In particular, it makes use of the following Lexical Cast function which is provided by the Boost library;
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<div class="command">
	boost::lexical_cast<Typename>(arg String)
	</div>

	<h2>Implication of dependencies.</h2>
	
	These dependencies on external software libraries come with one big implication, and that is;
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<div class="note">

		The system upon which the package is being configured, built, and installed, must have an appropriate version of both the GSL and
		the Boost Library installed on it.

	</div>

	<br>

	Thus, the person who is responsible for configuring, building, and installing this package, must ensure that
	appropriate versions of both of these two dependent libraries are installed on the system. Furthermore, they may even need to know exactly where
	both of these libraries are installed on the system.

	<br>
	<br>

	<hr>

	<br>
	
	The next page discusses how to configure this package so that both the GSL and the Boost Library can be used by the build process.
